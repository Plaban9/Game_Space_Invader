# Space_Invader_Game
A 2D endless space shooter.

The project was created on Unity 4.6 then transferred to Unity 5 and ultimately Unity 2017.3 for WebGL build purposes.

Some Features of my version of the game: -

1. Play According to your mood (Get groovy with Upbeat music or Enjoy the blissful journey with calm music.)

     - Features 6 sound tracks

     - Tracks divided into two sets of 3 songs each (Pre-sets - a. Upbeat b. Calm) 

     - Pre-set is randomly selected at load of the game (Refresh your browser if you are unlucky)

2. More freedom on Player Ship 
     -.Movement possible even in Y - axis also.

     - Added tilting of spaceship with movement

     - Added Bombs with cool down time. .

3. Feast your eyes with colour.

     - Extensive use of particle system (Explosion, Play Space, Projectile trails, Thrusters, UI elements on event  etc..)

4. Adjustable volume for Music and SFX

      - Adjust in Settings

5. Challenging Enemies

      - Enemies come in waves with each wave being more difficult and more rewarding

So on...
